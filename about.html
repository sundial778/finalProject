            <h2 style="font-weight:lighter;">One Step To A Sustainable Future</h2>
            <hr> We are striving for a greener planet. The world cannot sustain the current methods of waste disposal and managment.
            <br />Here are some facts about "E"-Waste:
            <div id="ul1">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In 2009, discarded TVs, computers, peripherals (including printers, scanners, fax machines) mice, keyboards, and cell phones totaled about 2.37 million short tons.
                    </li>
                    <li>E-waste represents 2% of America's trash in landfills, but it equals 70% of overall toxic waste.</li>
                    <li>20 to 50 million metric tons of e-waste are disposed worldwide every year.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Cell phones and other electronic items contain high amounts of precious metals like gold or silver. Americans dump phones containing over $60 million in gold/silver every year.</li>
                    <li>A large number of what is labeled as "e-waste" is actually not waste at all, but rather whole electronic equipment or parts that are readily marketable for reuse or can be recycled for materials recovery.</li>
                    <li>Only 12.5% of e-waste is currently recycled. </li>
                    <li>For every 1 million cell phones that are recycled, 35,274 lbs of copper, 772 lbs of silver, 75 lbs of gold, and 33 lbs of palladium can be recovered. </li>
                    <li>Recycling 1 million laptops saves the energy equivalent to the electricity used by 3,657 U.S. homes in a year. </li>
                    <li>E-waste is still the fastest growing municipal waste stream in America, according to the EPA. </li>
                    <li>It takes 530 lbs of fossil fuel, 48 lbs of chemicals, and 1.5 tons of water to manufacture one computer and monitor.</li>
                    <li>Electronic items that are considered to be hazardous include, but are not limited to: Televisions and computer monitors that contain cathode ray tubes, LCD desktop monitors, LCD televisions, Plasma televisions, Portable DVD players with LCD screens.</li>

            <h3 style="position:relative; left:10%;"> A Letter From Our Founder</h3>
            <div id="letter">
                <p>Thank you for visiting our website. With your continued support, we can make this world a better place. Technology is moving faster than the planet and while the majority makes the world a better place, the obsolete denizens of yesteryears tecnological waste is left to choke the arteries of our home. My company is resolved to repurpose this wasted technology. There are many components that can be reused on a circuit board. The manufacturing industry of today produces so many things that could easily be gathered from what was already produced. Our propriety method of repurposing components have saved over 400 cubic feet of space from a landfill. By the end of 2016, we plan to save 1000. Help us achieve our dream of a sustainable future for all of us. </p>
